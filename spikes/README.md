Spikes:

Input:
input.c: Asks for user input for a,b, and c from quadratic equation and prints out the float values.
input2.c: Alternate version of input.c which uses command-line arguments and prints out the float values of a,b, and c.

Rootfinder:
rootfinder.c: Takes a,b, and c from quadratic equation and finds roots x1 and x2. This one only calls function once to test.

float_parts:
float_parts.c: Takes a single precision float input (does not validate) and returns the sign bit, exponent, and mantissa in hexidecimal.
